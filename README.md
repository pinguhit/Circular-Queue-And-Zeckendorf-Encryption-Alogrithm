# Circular-Queue-And-Zeckendorf-Encryption-Alogrithm
Algorithm to encrypt a word using a circular queue, zeckendorf representation and a keyword. Upon taking an input word, a keyword the algorithm will encrypt the data, show the binary representation of the encrypted text and then decrypt the data.
